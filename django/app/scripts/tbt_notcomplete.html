    <p>Respected Sir/Madam,</p>
    <p>Greetings from e-Yantra!</p>
    <p>Thank you for your interest in e-Yantra Lab Setup Initiative (eLSI). As per our record, your college,
      {{CollegeName}}, {{District}}, {{State}} has already submitted a Letter of Intent (LoI) to participate
        in this initiative and following teachers from your college have been trained through a hands-on two day
        workshop conducted at {{host_college}}, {{host_District}}, {{host_State}} on {{start_date}} to {{end_date}}:</p>
          <table>
            <thead>
              {% for dtl in lst%}
              <th>{{dtl}}</th>
              {%endfor%}
            </thead>
            <tbody>
              <tr>
                {%for var in datas.data %}
                {% for dtl in var.value%}
                <td>
                  {{dtl}}
                </td>
                {%endfor%}
              </tr>
              {%endfor%}
            </tbody>
          </table>
    <p>One robotic kit is given by e-Yantra to the college for teacher team to complete online Task Based Training
      (TBT). However, the teacher team did not complete the TBT and also the purchase of equipments for the lab
      setup was not done. Thus the process of e-Yantra Lab Setup at your institute is yet incomplete.</p>
       <p>We would be happy to have your same/different teacher team attend our workshop as a
         refresher course and participate in TBT.</p>
         <p>You may attend any of the workshops planned across the country. Please find their details here:
